# Contributing to the RCM-DX Specifigation

First of all, thank you very much for your help!

## Where to get help

Help is provided through our Stack Overflow Question Board. Maybe your question is already there and an answer is ready, otherwise someone will surely answer your question!

## What do I need to know

Requests for changes are evaluated by a committee. If the request is useful for the majority, it is included in an upcoming release. Don't be angry with us if it doesn't make it into the next release or even if it doesn't make it into a release at all.  
Major changes to this specification will result in major changes in the software that follows this specification, so such changes are well thought out and take some time.

## How can I contribute

### Any bugs found

In the specification, these can be spelling mistakes, grammar errors, errors in the pictograms, errors in the links (or broken links) and so on. Mistakes happen and we would be grateful if you could let us know. Just create an entry in our error list and we will take care of it as soon as possible!  

### Suggest improvements

Improvements are desired and drive success. To suggest an improvement, you can either make an adjustment yourself and send it to us via Pull Request or you write us an entry in our feature list [HERE THE LINK: TODO!]().
